<h2>Ward </h2>
<pre>

    The Delux Ward comprising of Delux & SuperDelux Suite rooms is a state of the art facility.
    Comprehensive comfort, care and cure of the patient is the priority.

</pre>

<h2>Services</h2>

<pre>
    
    Patients are assigned a ward or a room based on the type of care they need and the availability of the bed. Typically, 
    each general ward houses eight cubicles and each cubicle provides hospital bed to six patients. 
    When patients request a private room we make every effort to meet their request. We have 20 private rooms.
    All private rooms have a phone, attached toilet, a closet for personal belongings and a bedside control for 
    contacting a member of the staff.

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<pre>

    A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment.
    The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat 
    urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. 
    A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and 
    additional beds for patients who need long-term care. 
    Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, 
    and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) 
    and certain disease categories.
    Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.
    Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.
