<h2> casuality</h2>
<pre>

  An emergency department (ED), also known as an accident & emergency department (A&E), emergency room (ER), 
  emergency ward (EW) or casualty department, is a medical treatment facility specializing in emergency medicine, 
  the acute care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance.
  The emergency department is usually found in a hospital or other primary care center.

  Due to the unplanned nature of patient attendance, the department must provide initial treatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, 
  some of which may be life-threatening and require immediate attention. In some countries, emergency departments have become important 
  entry points for those without other means of access to medical care.

</pre>

<h2>Services</h2>

<pre>
    A post graduate Casualty Medical Officer (CMO) and skilled nursing staff are available 24*7 for patient service.
    The best thing at LPMH Casualty is that, when an accident, trauma or assault patient comes here with serious injury, 
    we do not insist on filling any kind of form or ask any information. 
    The aim at that particular moment is to provide him/her the required basic life support service. 
    For such patients, a basic life support service is provided for 6 hours.
    The compassionate and caring attitude of their staff and outstanding emergency medical services provided by them, 
    ranks Lifepoint Multispecialty Hospital No.1 and preferred choice of all patients in close vicinity.
    
</pre>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<pre>
    Certified first responders or emergency medical responders may arrive as part of local emergency medical services,
    or may arrive on their own. They will assist with all aspects of patient care, including triage and treatment at the scene, 
    and transport from the scene to the hospital.
    Paramedic and emergency medical technician (EMT) personnel may arrive in ambulances, in their personal vehicles, or 
    from another agency. They will have control of all aspects of patient care, 
    as assigned by the medical officer or incident commander.
    Ground ambulances will be assigned to the transport sector to transport patients and personnel to
    and from the incident scene, emergency departments of hospitals, and a designated helipad. 
    These ambulances may be municipal services, volunteer services, or from private corporations.
    Air ambulances will transport patients from the scene or from designated helipads to receiving hospitals.
