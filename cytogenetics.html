 		<br>⊙  The cytogenetics laboratory at kamalnayanbajaj hospital is very well equipped with the state of the art laboratory facilities and well
    trained laboratory personals.</br>
<br>⊙  This is the only center in entire marathwada region that provide a complete range of cytogenetic diagnostic and prognostic tests
    with the goal of providing high quality and timely results to enable clinician to attain the most accurate diagnosis possible.</br>
<br>⊙  The cytogenetics laboratory maintains broad profile of services and offers expert genetic interpretation of constitutional which
    include prenatal testing, postnatal constitutional analysis and testing for acquired abnormalities like neoplasia.</br>
<br>⊙  The laboratory performs testing on a wide range of different tissue sample such as -Peripheral blood, Bone marrow, Chorionic villus
    (CVS), Amniotic fluid, Cord blood, Tissue (skin biopsy), product of conception (POC), lymph node and solid tumor(Formalin fixed
    embedded tissue).</br>
<br>⊙  We take consultative and integrated approach to cytogenetic analysis and work closely with referring clinician to correlate</br>
    <br>cytogenetics and FISH result with the result of other diagnostic modalities including haematopathology, flow cytometry and</br>
   <br> molecular diagnostics to provide comprehensive picture of patient cytogenetics status at various disease course.</br>
<br>⊙  Digital imaging (Both bright field and fluorescence microscopy) are performed using Leica GSL 10 Automated scanning platform.</br>
    Chromosome analysis and FISH analysis are performed using the Leica CytoVision software.
<br>⊙  Fees and all pertinent information related to all cytogenetics test are available upon request. Please contact cytogenetics
    laboratory for more information.</br>
