<h2>Laboratories </h2>
<pre>

    A medical laboratory or clinical laboratory is a laboratory where clinical pathology tests are carried out on clinical specimens to 
    obtain information about the health of a patient to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.
    Clinical Medical laboratories are an example of applied science,as opposed to research laboratories that focus on basic science, 
    such as found in some academic institutions.

<h2>Services</h2>

    Clinical lab services are tests on specimens from the body (such as blood or urine) that are used to diagnose and treat patients.
